# singly-linked-list_implementation

This repository contains a menu-driven C program for implementing the basic operations in a **Singly Linked List (SLL)**.

The program implements the following operations:

--> Insertion: insertion at beginning
               insertion at end
               insertion before a particular element
               insertion after a particular element

--> Deletion: deletion from beginning
              deletion from end
              deletion of a particular element
              deletion before a particular element
              deletion after a particular element
              
--> Searching

--> Sorting: sorting in increasing order
             sorting in descending order

--> Reversing

--> Display
